The shell must support the following internal commands:

cd  - change the current default directory. If the  argument is not present, report the current directory. If the directory does not exist an appropriate error should be reported. This command should also change the PWD environment variable.
clr - clear the screen.
dir  - list the contents of directory e.g. ls -al <directory>
environ - list all the environment strings
echo  - echo  on the display followed by a new line (multiple spaces/tabs may be reduced to a single space)
help - display the user manual using the more filter.  
pause - pause operation of the shell until 'Enter' is pressed
quit - quit the shell
